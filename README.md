# BoBo-SSH-Kit
- **BoBo-SSH-Kit** is a comprehensive solution that offers both SSH client and server implementations, designed to help users securely connect to and manage remote systems.
- With an emphasis on security and ease of use, BoBo-SSH-Kit allows users to establish encrypted connections, remotely manage server instances, and transfer files securely over the SSH protocol.

# Core Utilities 
- **BoBoSSH** is a lightweight and reliable client for initiating secure connections to remote servers, enabling users to execute commands and transfer files
- **BoBoServer** is a low-latent ssh-server implemented using epoll for efficient I/O event handling and threadpool for execution of tasks by worker threads
- **BoBo-SSH-Server** is a ssh-server based on traditional fork model for handling clients in a separate child process for isolation & robust shell experience
